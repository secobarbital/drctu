    <title>For most women, pregnancy is the nine months of her life where she most likely to treat her body and mind with the utmost respect.  It is the nine months of her life where she nourishes her body with wholesome food and educates herself on the &quot;Do's and Don’ts of pregnancy&quot; in preparation for her new baby. Science emerges every year with new studies to replace old methodology. In the past, exercise was discouraged and rest encouraged. Extended periods of rest can lead to bone density issues and decrease in core muscle strength.   Current studies show that exercise is one of the best ways to safe guard your body from biomechanical problems during pregnancy, but it also helps your body maintain it's strength and resiliency through the birthing process and aid in recovery.   Here are a few tips in creating a healthy exercise program for you and your baby...


1. Be realistic of your exercise goals.   Depending on your stage of pregnancy, it important not to over exert yourself.    Most women gain an average of 25-35 lbs. during their pregnancy.  The drastic weight gain and outward growing of the &quot;belly&quot; causes the biomechanics of the body and spine to change.  As mass increases, your body must compensate and redistribute load, and often, not favorably.    The idea of exercise is to strengthen your body so that the body can accommodate the change in load.  Overexertion during exercise can lead to injury.  Disc bulges and sciatica are common side effects of excess load, poor biomechanics, and overexertion.   Though they are relatively easy to treat from a chiropractic standpoint, the discomfort that a woman suffers from these conditions is definitely not worth the overexertion.  With that said, it is safer to take a moderate approach to choosing and starting an exercise regime.  Remember that vigorous exercise regardless of what stage of pregnancy you are in, can be detrimental to your own body. 
2. Choose a combination of both low-impact and non-impact exercises/activities.   Low impact exercises such as a brisk 45 minute walk, provides a healthy load to bones to help maintain bone density and provides a decent cardiovascular workout.  Swimming is great for expectant mothers since it is a non-weight bearing activity, and decreases stress to joints as weight gain increases.   If yoga is of interest, ask your local yoga studio if they offer yoga for pregnant moms.   In general, yoga is excellent in developing core muscles that help stabilize the low back and pelvis.   
3. Listen to your body.  Whether pain is described as an ache, sharp, dull, it is still pain.  Exercise shouldn't hurt your body. Gradually ramp your body up to your new exercise regime.  Don't forget that the hormone Relaxin is running rampant through your body during your pregnancy and even months after.  Relaxin causes laxity of ligaments and joints throughout the body.  It is very important that you exercise within a range of motion that is healthy for your joints.   
4. Water up.  Don't forget to hydrate, especially if you are exercising in a warmer climate.  It is important to replenish lost fluids.  Pregnant moms are also at higher risk to  bladder infections.  Drinking ample water to flush your system promotes good kidney/bladder function and health.

5.  Feed your mecca.  If you're increasing your level of activity with exercise, it is important to also feed your body the ample amount of calories to do so.  Pack simple snacks like an apple, bag of carrots, slices of cheese, or even beef jerky, in your car or exercise bag.  Make healthy snacks accessible so that your body doesn't crash.


The laws of biological development lead most women to feel like a water balloon waiting to explode by months 8 and 9.  A moderate, consistent, and safe exercise regime can help decrease that feeling and help you develop strength and stability to safely compensate for your rapidly changing body.  Please remember-- Every woman's body is different and each pregnancy is different.  Each week will bring changes to both you and your baby. If you are unsure of your body's limitations ask your physician to review your health and family history to find out what types of exercises would be safe for you.  Enjoy your journey on becoming a new mom, or having another addition to your household.</title>
