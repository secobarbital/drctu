### What is a chiropractor?

A chiropractor is essentially a body mechanic.  Like the mechanical parts of a machine such as a car, the spine and your body function optimally when it is in proper alignment.  When the wheels of a care are out of alignment, it is more difficult to steer.  Not only do the tires wear more quickly, but other parts of the car that are working against the road break down.  While tires and car parts are replaceable, the joints and soft tissues of your spine are not!   Prevention and early detection are keys to maintaining optimal function and extending the life of your spine and body.

### Why chiropractic? 

The chiropractic adjustment positively influences the vitality in each human being by decreasing stress on the nervous system.  A well-balanced and aligned body allows for physical harmony, and prevention of degenerative changes, illnesses, and injury.  The quality of one’s life improves as the body is given the opportunity to function at a more optimal state.

### What does treatment involve?

On your initial visit, a complete history is taken and an analysis of both the spinal column and the body’s structure is conducted searching for areas of subluxation (misalignment) and spinal nerve stress. Next a comprehensive examination is performed to determine the best treatment for you.  Findings are discussed with you to fully explain results and treatment options. The Doctor then carefully tailors a program to meet your specific needs and help you attain your goals.  Appropriate, gentle chiropractic treatment is then applied to rebalance and realign the body.  This realignment is called an adjustment.  Adjustments are painless and take a short amount of time.

### What results can I expect?

Chiropractic can often provide immediate relief. When the structural integrity of your joint is restored and no longer subjected to the stress of misalignment, muscles and soft tissue can heal more quickly.  Recovery is normally faster and more complete when you address multiple components of your pain.

### Do chiropractors treat more than just backs?

Chiropractors in the State of California are primary care physicians.  This means that they can use diagnostic techniques and equipment to evaluate possible causes for your pain and discomfort and make appropriate recommendations and referrals if necessary.

Though there are different types of chiropractors just as there are medical doctors,  Dr. Tu is trained with the latest techniques and focuses on the body as a whole unit.  In fact, most of her patients visit her office for a variety of reasons, including headaches, carpal tunnel, shoulder pain, numbness and/or tingling, and more.  So yes, Dr. Tu treats more than just backs!

### Why is posture important?

Posture is the window to your structural health.  Poor posture causes the body to work harder to keep your body in a balanced state.  For example, slouching can cause your low back muscles to ache whereas sitting up straight keeps the spine in a more neutral position and requires less work by related muscles.

### I’m hurt and I feel pain.  Should I use ice or heat?

Often pain is a result of the body’s natural process of inflammation.  Though conventional medical treatment (such as Advil, Asprin, or Tylenol) may help with pain management, it is best to start with ice.  Your chiropractor can give you instructions specific for your injury.  Though heat may initially feel good, it often causes an increase in the inflammation process and can impede healing.  

### Can chiropractic help headaches?

Headaches are often misdiagnosed as migraines.  In fact, the majority of headaches come from a combination of stress and poor posture.  Poor posture causes muscles to work in a stressed state, often causing tension in the upper shoulder and neck regions.  This tension and stress usually hovers under the top of the neck and can precipitate into “eyeball” headaches, and even temple headaches.  Realigning the spine through a chiropractic adjustment and posture re-education can significantly reduce and relieve headaches.

### Do children need chiropractic?

Due to the many falls and injuries sustained by children in their daily activities, their backbones may begin to curve or twist (scoliosis) causing compression of spinal nerves.  This can result in symptoms such as headaches, earaches and varied types of childhood aches and pains.  A child’s spine and body should be checked by a chiropractor, just as their teeth are checked by a dentist.

### I’m pregnant.  Is chiropractic safe for me and my child?

Suffering from Sciatica? Sacro-iliac joint pain? Round ligament pain? Want to prevent “back labor?” Chiropractic is not only safe for pregnant women, but it can help relieve bodily discomfort during and after pregnancy. Instead of having a pleasant pregnancy, many women suffer from back pain due to weight gain and a change in their centre of gravity.  

Hormones also cause laxity in joints and, inadvertently, increase load and stress to back muscles.  During labor, 50 - 75% of women suffer from "back labor" where the fetus compresses on sensitive spinal nerves.  Following pregnancy, women have a tendency to carry their babies and toddlers on one hip.  Chiropractic can help women throughout all stages of pregnancy and the post-natal period.

### How about infants?

Childbirth can be an extreme experience for both mother and child.  Both natural childbirth and Cesarean sections require the infant to be moved through a small pathway.  Physicians often twist, turn and pull the infant in order to assist the birthing process. Childbirth can certainly be stressful on an infants’ spine.  Colic, unusual crying, high fever, poor appetite, ear infections, or inconsistent sleeping habits can be signs of spinal distress.  Since the structure of the newborn’s spine is mostly still cartilage unlike an adult spine, adjustments are made with very gentle pressure.

### Can chiropractic help scoliosis?

Any sideways curvature and excessive rotation of the spine is abnormal.  Depending on age and severity, chiropractic can help slow the progression of scoliosis and also help with pain management.  

### What is sciatica?

The sciatic nerve is the large nerve that begins in the lower spine and extends into the lower body.  When the sciatic nerve becomes inflamed, the condition is called sciatica.  The pain typically is localized in the buttock region and can extend in an “electrical” fashion down the back of the leg and even into the toes.  Numbness and tingling may even occur.  The inflammation is typically caused by compression on the nerve either from the spine or often from adjacent structures in the pelvis.  Sciatica can be effectively treated through chiropractic.

### Why am I having pain in other areas of my body?

Spinal distortion can alter normal nerve and nervous system function. Your body functions as a whole, not as individual parts.  When one body system is disturbed, there is a response throughout the body.  Many conditions that may seem unrelated to the spine and/or nerve system may respond favorably with improved spine function.  Optimal health is a state in which ALL of the systems of the body are functioning at their best.

### Why should I return if I’m feeling better?

Depending on your condition, a few chiropractic adjustments can help restore your body’s proper alignment and decrease pain.  Returning for chiropractic adjustments and following through with your care plan that your chiropractor has designed for you, is like having your dentist tighten your braces on your teeth until your teeth are straight again.
