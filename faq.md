### What is a chiropractor?

A chiropractor is essentially a body mechanic.  Like the mechanical parts of a machine such as a car, the spine and your body function optimally when it is in proper alignment.  When the wheels of a care are out of alignment, it is more difficult to steer.  Not only do the tires wear more quickly, but other parts of the car that are working against the road break down.  While tires and car parts are replaceable, the joints and soft tissues of your spine are not!   Prevention and early detection are keys to maintaining optimal function and extending the life of your spine and body.

### Why chiropractic? 

The chiropractic adjustment positively influences the vitality in each human being by decreasing stress on the nervous system.  A well-balanced and aligned body allows for physical harmony, and prevention of degenerative changes, illnesses, and injury.  The quality of one’s life improves as the body is given the opportunity to function at a more optimal state.

### What does treatment involve?

On your initial visit, a complete history is taken and an analysis of both the spinal column and the body’s structure is conducted searching for areas of subluxation (misalignment) and spinal nerve stress. Next a comprehensive examination is performed to determine the best treatment for you.  Findings are discussed with you to fully explain results and treatment options. The Doctor then carefully tailors a program to meet your specific needs and help you attain your goals.  Appropriate, gentle chiropractic treatment is then applied to rebalance and realign the body.  This realignment is called an adjustment.  Adjustments are painless and take a short amount of time.
