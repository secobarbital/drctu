    <title>As the weather improves and temperatures rise, the risks of dehydration and hyperthermia increase for many older adults. Alarmingly, dehydration is one of the top 10 reasons for hospitalizations for those over 65.
Many seniors notice that they are not as thirsty on a day-to-day basis as they were at younger ages. In fact, many older adults mistake the sensation of thirst for hunger. This loss in thirst is most prevalent in those 50 and older, and awareness of thirst continues to diminish. With age, the way our bodies metabolize and use water changes. This reason alone makes it extremely important for seniors to be more conscientious about drinking fluids throughout the day.
Water is a vital component of our bodies. At the age of 35, water constitutes approximately 60 percent of one’s body weight. As many seniors age, they lose muscle mass and, because one of the major constituents of muscle is water, they lose water as well. By the age of 75, the loss of muscle mass means that only 50 percent of our body weight is made up of water.
Normal and proper kidney function depends on the presence of water to excrete waste products such as uric acid and urea. Drinking water helps to eliminate waste that can otherwise create serious conditions such as bladder infections, constipation and other digestive problems. Drinking a consistent amount of water every day also helps to flush toxins that are agents in causing pain, stiffness and inflammation. Therefore, it is vitally important to replenish your body with water throughout the day to maintain normal body functions.
Various medications, especially those related to hyper- or hypotension, can alter how the body absorbs water and how the water exits the body. It is important to consult with a physician as to how much water one should be drinking when taking medication. Commonly, postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy experience water retention. Vitamin and mineral supplementation rarely alters water absorption, but the constituents of vitamin B can change the color of urine.
Many seniors with urinary incontinence, sedentary lifestyles or physical disabilities that make it difficult to get to the bathroom mistakenly believe that they can alleviate these conditions by drinking less water. On average, however, a normal functioning set of kidneys daily filters 200 quarts of blood, ridding the body of 2 quarts of waste and excess water. Even those with a sedentary lifestyle require sufficient water intake to void waste from the body.
For seniors leading more active lifestyles, water helps to regulate body temperature. The risk of heat stroke, hypotension and dehydration increases with the rise in ambient temperature. With physical activity in hotter weather, it is vitally important to replenish water lost through perspiration.
Chronic signs of dehydration start as simply as dry lips and scaly skin that lacks elasticity. More serious signs and symptoms include but are not limited to dry mouth, muscle weakness or cramps, onset of headache, fatigue, confusion and increased heart rate.
Many seniors forget that extreme fluid loss as a result of vomiting or diarrhea can cause dehydration. In such cases, it is important to replenish fluids slowly. Of course, drinking too much water could lead to other serious complications (and in extreme cases even death) by overdiluting vital and essential electrolytes in the blood.
Although each person’s ideal water intake varies depending on other conditions or limiting factors, good health requires a consistent, healthful amount of water. Hydrate and rejuvenate.
 
Staying hydrated...
Following are simple tips to help stay well hydrated during the summer months.
• Drink 8-10 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Sip water slowly throughout the day, rather than gulping it.
• Avoid excessive sugary and caffeinated drinks that can alter kidney function or serve as a diuretic. Vegetable juice, low-fat milk and herbal teas are good alternatives. A simple rule of thumb: The bladder should become full in three to five hours, and urine color should be light yellow. Dark-yellow urine is normally an indicator that you need to drink more water. If you experience burning or pain with urination, consult a physician.
• Keep water available in the car and by the bedside. You’re more likely to drink it if you see it.
• If you drink coffee or highly caffeinated products, replenish with 2 cups of water for every cup of coffee.</title>
