Home life fluctuates decade to decade.  Many seniors fall into the time-line where their home that was once filled with pitter pattering feet, years of laughter and rambunctiousness, soon turn to a quiet and empty home.   Now even more so, seniors lifestyles are changing drastically due to the turn in the economy.  The standard of living is excellent, yet the cost of living increases year-to-year.  Often seniors face the reality of fixed incomes through retirement.   As life comes full circle, there comes the inevitable decision of where to lead your remaining years and who will be your support system.  Whether in stellar health or deteriorating condition, the option for many seniors to move in with their adult children or vice-versa is often a viable solution.  Though there are both advantages and disadvantages to this transition the following are a few factors that should be considered before making a home with your adult children.  Safety comes first.   The transition of joining homes with an adult child needs to include an environment that functionally works for the senior.   Coordination and agility decreases with age.  Staying active through proper daily exercise slows this process, but inevitably as we approach our Golden Years, conditions such as osteoarthritis can cause challenges as simple as turning a door knob versus a door lever.  There are many inexpensive home improvements that can be made to make the living experience of a senior easier such as installing low-pile carpet to prevent trips and falls. .
Finances  Expert in guiding his clients through life transitions, Brett Macauley of Ameriprise Financial, notes that dialogue regarding future health care and living arrangements for seniors often occurs when the health of a senior is not at best.  &quot;Financially speaking, the cost of home care, assisted living, or skilled nursing care can take a severe toll to the net worth of either the senior and/or the adult children if not planned properly.  Long term care insurance is far too often ignored or not planned for as part of the senior's financial plan and if appropriate, should be purchased as early as possible.&quot;  When a senior decides to join households with their adult child, it is equally important to discuss how costs of living will be divided amongst the members of the household.  
Multigenerational melting pot &amp; boundaries  Sharing a roof with your children may sound easy, but it can be time consuming for adult children.  Michelle Rogers of Home Instead Senior care shared studies that show that adult children feel they lack time for themselves and their own family when caring for their loved parent(s).  It also becomes extremely stressful on both parties if the health of the senior begins to decline. Properly managing a balancing a healthy environment in the home is a challenge.    It is important to set boundaries for the senior and adult children and family in terms of space and time.  On the contrary, a senior living with their adult children can often create a closer connection culturally and sense of family between generations.  Not all seniors have extended family that live locally, nor are adult children and their families necessarily going to mix well with senior parents.  Expert in Senior living, Michelle Rogers of Home Instead Senior Care stresses the importance of carefully planning healthy living environments and scenarios for aging adults.  Michelle has helped thousands of families create solutions that entail simple meal prep for seniors to orchestrating the transition of seniors mending homes with the adult child.  Home Instead Senior care offers a booklet that has more tips on household modification and further details on making a transition with your adult child.  </title>
